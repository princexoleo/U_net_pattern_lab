## U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
This repository created for CSI 416 (Pattern Recognition Lab) projects. <br>

In this repostitory we are trying to build the U-Net algorithm. We are also trying to build U-Net in different framework like keras, pytorch, fastai. For datasources, we use kaggle api to download data from kaggle. For implementation. we use colab beacause colab is easy to use and also support free GPU. Basically, we are trying to find out how u-net algorithm is works and we hope that we already learned a lot with this state-of-the-art algorithm.
